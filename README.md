# Figma - Design
Our team utilized Figma to design mock-ups of active webpages before development. Mock-Ups are made available for view by visiting this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/tyePR4TZbI1fXEQCzFPheX/?node-id=0%3A1). 

The Figma contains the following three pages:
- Iterations of the Website
  - Home Page Mock-Ups (High Fidelity and Medium Fidelity)
